Welcome to your new TanStack app!

This is the basic TanStack starter, but using the Bun runtime and Bun's file APIs.

## Getting Started

To run this application:

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

## Building For Production

To build this application for production:

```bash
bun run build
```

### Styling

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

### Routing

This project uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) with file-based routing. Routes are managed as files in `src/routes`.

## Demo files

Files prefixed with `demo` can be safely deleted. They are there to provide a starting point for you to play around with the features you've installed.

## Learn More

You can learn more about all of the offerings from TanStack in the [TanStack documentation](https://tanstack.com).
